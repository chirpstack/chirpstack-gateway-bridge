# Events

Events are generated by the ChirpStack Gateway Bridge and forwarded to the configured
integration. Depending the `marshaler` configuration, these are sent as JSON or
[Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/). For the Protobuf
definitions, please refer to [gw.proto](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-network-server/blob/master/api/gw/gw.proto).

* The Protocol Buffers [JSON Mapping](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json)
  defines that bytes must be encoded as base64 strings. This also affects the `gatewayID` field.
  When re-encoding this filed to HEX encoding, you will find the expected gateway ID string.

## `stats` - gateway statistics

Statistics reported by the gateway.

### JSON

### Protobuf

This message is defined by the `UplinkFrame` Protobuf message.

## `ack` - Downlink acknowledgement

Acknowledgement (or error) after a downlink command.

Possible error values are:

* `TOO_LATE`: Rejected because it was already too late to program this packet for downlink
* `TOO_EARLY`: Rejected because downlink packet timestamp is too much in advance
* `COLLISION_PACKET`: Rejected because there was already a packet programmed in requested timeframe
* `COLLISION_BEACON`: Rejected because there was already a beacon planned in requested timeframe
* `TX_FREQ`: Rejected because requested frequency is not supported by TX RF chain
* `TX_POWER`: Rejected because requested power is not supported by gateway
* `GPS_UNLOCKED`: Rejected because GPS is unlocked, so GPS timestamp cannot be used

### JSON

{{<highlight json>}}
{
    "gatewayID": "cnb/AC4GLBg=",
    "token": 12345,
    "error": "GPS_UNLOCKED"
}
{{< /highlight >}}

### Protobuf

This message is defined by the `DownlinkTXAck` Protobuf message.

## `exec` - Command execution response

The `exec` event is sent back after an `exec` command and contains the
execution output (or possible error).

### JSON

{{<highlight json>}}
{
    "gatewayID": "cnb/AC4GLBg=",
    "token": "[BASE64 ENCODED BLOB]",
    "stdout": "[BASE64 ENCODED BLOB]",
    "stderr": "[BASE64 ENCODED BLOB]",
    "error": "optional error message"
}
